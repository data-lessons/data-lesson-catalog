title: Open Science for Synthesis (OSS)
description: "OSS is a three-week intensive course on the use of open science tools for 
	synthesis research. It covers data science basics, including data management, scripting 
	and software practices, workflows, statistical techniques for synthesis, collaboration 
	and communication. Group synthesis projects are used to ground these skills in 
	real-world examples."
